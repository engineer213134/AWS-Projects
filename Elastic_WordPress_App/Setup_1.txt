Stage 1 Demo

Setup the environment which WordPress will run from.
Configure some SSM Parameters which the manual and automatic stages of this advanced demo series will use
and perform a manual install of wordpress and a database on the same EC2 instance.
This is the starting point .. the common wordpress configuration which you will evolve over the coming demo stages.


STAGE 1A - Login to an AWS Account
Create VPC needed for wordpress app (There is a provided link which creates the stack needed for the wordpress application)

STAGE 1B - Create an EC2 Instance to run wordpress
Move to the EC2 console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1
Click Launch Instance

For name use Wordpress-Manual
Select Amazon Linux
From the dropdown make sure Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type AMI is selected
ensure 64-bit (x86) is selected in the architecture dropdown.
Under instance type
Select whatever instance shows as Free tier eligible (probably t2 or t3.micro)
Under Key Pair(login) select Proceed without a KeyPair (not recommended)
For Network Settings, click Edit and in the VPC download select A4LVPC
for Subnet select sn-Pub-A
Make sure for both Auto-assign public IP and Auto-assign IPv6 IP you set to Enable

STAGE 1B - Create SSM Parameter Store values for wordpress
see (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) for info on SSM
See why we need SSM https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/h/analyzing-hidden-danger-of-environment-variables-for-keeping-secrets.html


Storing configuration information within the SSM Parameter store scales much better than attempting to script them in some way. 
In this sub-section you are going to create parameters to store the important configuration items for the platform you are building.

Open a new tab to https://console.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/home?region=us-east-1


Create Parameter - DBUser (the login for the specific wordpress DB)
Click Create Parameter Set Name to /A4L/Wordpress/DBUser Set Description to Wordpress Database User
Set Tier to Standard
Set Type to String
Set Data type to text
Set Value to a4lwordpressuser
Click Create parameter

Create Parameter - DBName (the name of the wordpress database)
Click Create Parameter Set Name to /A4L/Wordpress/DBName Set Description to Wordpress Database Name
Set Tier to Standard
Set Type to String
Set Data type to text
