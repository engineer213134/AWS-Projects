Welcome to STAGE1 of this Advanced Demo where you will gain practical experience using a Hybrid ONPREMISES & AWS DNS Environment You will perform the following tasks:-

Provision the environments <== THIS STAGE
Verify no IP & DNS Connectivity <== THIS STAGE
Configure a VPC Peer between the environments
Configure inbound R53 Endpoints allowing the on-premises environment to resolve AWS
Configure outbound R53 Endpoints allowing the AWS environment to resolve on-premises






STAGE 1C - VERIFY THERE IS NO CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTS


Move to the EC2 Console https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1
Click Running Instances

Type ping THEIPADDRESSYOUJUSTCOPIED
Verify you DON'T Receive a ping response ... proving that there is no networking connectivity between the AWS and ON-PREMISES Environments
Close down the session manager tab to A4L-AWS-EC2-A
Select A4L-ONPREM-APP right click, select connect, choose session manager, click connect Type ping web.aws.animals4life.org
Verify you get the error ping: web.aws.animals4life.org: Name or Service not known

Select A4L-AWS-EC2-A and copy its Private IP into your clipboard
Move back to the session manager connection to A4L-ONPREM-APP
Type ping THEIPADDRESSYOUJUSTCOPIED
