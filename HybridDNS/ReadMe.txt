A hybrid DNS for Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a type of Domain Name System (DNS) architecture that combines both internal and external DNS services.
The internal DNS component is used to manage and resolve internal domain names within an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), 
while the external component is used to resolve public domain names and manage public internet traffic. 
This architecture provides a secure and scalable solution for organizations to manage their DNS infrastructure within the AWS cloud.

With a hybrid DNS setup, organizations can leverage the benefits of both internal and external DNS services to manage their domain names, 
while ensuring that their internal network remains secure and isolated from the public internet. 
The hybrid approach also provides greater flexibility in terms of scaling and managing network traffic, 
allowing organizations to easily redirect traffic between internal and external resources as needed.
